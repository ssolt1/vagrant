# lamp project drawbacks

1 - Redundancy < passwords repeated several times.
    use variables - 
2 - Root passwd saved in clear text in files - use ansible-vault
# to encrypt password file
$ ansible-vault encrypt credential_staging_vars.yml # enter passwd to encryptdecrypt passwd_file
$ cat credential_staging_vars.yml # to see the file is encrypted
$ ansible-vault decrypt --ask-vault-pass credential_staging_vars.yml 
$ cat credential_staging_vars.yml # show decrypted file
# to use interactively in ansible-playbook cmd
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/mysql.yml --ask-vault-pass # will be prompted for encrypt/decrypt passwd
# create hidden file for encrypt/decrypt passwd under - ~/.ansible/<vault_passwd_file>
# Use in ansible-playbook cmd, use '--vault-password-file ~/.ansible/vault_pass' 
$ ansible-playbook /vagrant/playbooks/mysql.yml --vault-password-file ~/.ansible/vault_pass
